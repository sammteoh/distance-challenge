                <h3>Total Distance</h3>
                <p>
                    The total distance of a student is calculated by summing the distances run each week. 
                    The total distance of a category (ex. House, Gender, Grade) is calculated by summing the distances of its individual members each week.
                </p>
                <h3>Average Distance</h3>
                <p>
                    The average distance is calculated by dividing the total distance run by the number of weeks where the distance run was greater than zero.
                </p>
                <h3>Standard Deviation (Coefficient of Variation)</h3>
                <p>
                    The "consistency" of a student is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of a student's distances per week by the average distance run by the student per week. 
                    The lower the number is, the higher the consistency. The higher the number is, the lower the consistency.
                </p>
                <h3>Max/Min Distance</h3>
                <p>
                    The maximum distance is the greatest distance run in a single session. The minimum distance is the lowest distance run in a single session.
                </p>
                <h3>Weeks Above Threshold</h3>
                <p>
                    This metric counts the number of weeks a student has run at least 10 kilometers in a single session.
                </p>
                <h3>Improvement</h3>
                <p>
                    Improvement is calculated by dividing the difference between the current week's distance and the previous week's distance by the previous week's distance as a percentage. 
                    A negative number means deterioration, and a positive number means improvement from the previous week.
